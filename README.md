#100DaysOfCode - C# ðŸš€
This repository documents my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, focusing on backend development with C#. Over the next 100 days, I will build real-world projects, strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and explore essential concepts for professional development.

ðŸ“Œ What will you find here?
âœ… Hands-on projects with real-world applications
âœ… OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
âœ… Data persistence with files and databases
âœ… Best practices and code refactoring
âœ… Progressive development through structured challenges

Each week will feature a main challenge, culminating in a well-structured project. Follow my progress, and feel free to share feedback and suggestions!

ðŸ“… Challenge start date: March 16, 2025
ðŸ”¥ Commitment: Code and learn every day!

ðŸ’¡ Follow me to track this journey! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
